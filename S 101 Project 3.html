 <p><strong>Thoughts about HTML and working on a Web page</strong>.
<br /><br /> I think that HTML is like a safer version of Python or JavaScript for people who are just learning to  code and don’t want to learn a harder programing language. </p>
<h2>Answer the following questions on your page:</h2>
<br /><br />
<h3>What type of file is your web page saved as?</h3>
<p> A file with “.HTML” at the end.</p>
<h3>What are the three major tags the most basic web page needs?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>”body and /body”</li>
      <li>”h# and /h#”</li>
      <li>”p and /p”</li>
    </ul>
   <h3><strong>Where does the Head of a web page display when viewed in a web browser?</strong></h3>
   <p>Where the top of the webpage is.</p>
  <h3>Where does the Body of a web page display when viewed in a web browser?</h3>
   <p>Where the bulk of the webpage is, below the top.</p>
